Here is a simple demo of Tailwindcss in Jekyll with sass

[See the live demo](https://demos.julien-maury.dev/jekyll-tailwindcss/)

## How to use it

1. clone the repository
2. cd jekyll-tailwindcss
3. `bundle` to install jekyll dependencies
4. `yarn` to install node modules
5. `bundle exec jekyll serve` to run a local server

Enjoy!

## Purge

Note that I don't use the built-in purge CSS of Tailwind. Instead, I use a Jekyll plugin to purge unused CSS.

It's vital to understand how Tailwind purges CSS to avoid mistakes: 

> It doesn't try to parse your HTML and look for class attributes or dynamically execute your JavaScript â€” it simply looks for any strings in the entire file that match a regular expression

Please read the documenation. For example, the following won't work:

```html
<div class="text-{{  error  ?  'red'  :  'green'  }}-600"></div>
```
Instead always write the full class name, eg:

```html
<div class="{{  error  ?  'text-red-600'  :  'text-green-600'  }}"></div>
```
